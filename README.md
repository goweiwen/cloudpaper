### Connection Guide

```
For Unix-based Operating systems, do ssh <ip-address> -l <username>. Enter the password thereafter.
Once you're done,

do screen -r cloudpaper (If it doesn't work, find the name of the screen by doing screen -ls.)

Once all is good, you should be able to see the node's console. Ctrl + C followed by the following commands:
lsof -i :3000

and finally,

kill -9 <PID>

This allows us to properly kill the node that was previous active.

Last but not least,

git pull

followed by a yarn start.

```
